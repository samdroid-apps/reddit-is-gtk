# Installing

I did this ages ago, so I don't really remember.

1.  Install `gnome-common`
2.  Install the `python3-arrow`  and `python3-markdown`
3.  Install `libglib2.0-dev` and `libgtk2.0-dev`
4.  Install a SCSS compiler (eg. `rubygem-sass` on Fedora).  This is very
    important because otherwise it will fail to build.
    For Ubuntu run the following commands : 
    `sudo su -c "gem install sass"`
    `sudo gem install sass`

Then you can just install it like any usual program.

1.  Download the source code (eg. `git clone https://github.com/samdroid-apps/something-for-reddit; cd something-for-reddit`)
2.  `./autogen.sh`
3.  `make`
4.  `sudo make install`

There is a .desktop file, but it is also `reddit-is-gtk` command

Please report the bugs or deficiencies that you find via Github Issues.

# Roadmap
